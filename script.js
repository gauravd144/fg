                "question": "Define deep learning. Explain pros and cons of deep learning.",
                "answer": `Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to learn and extract patterns from large datasets. These neural networks are composed of interconnected nodes, or neurons, arranged in layers. Each layer processes the data and passes it onto the next layer for further abstraction. Deep learning algorithms iteratively improve their performance by adjusting the weights assigned to connections between neurons, a process known as training, until they can accurately perform tasks like classification, regression, or prediction.Pros of using deep learning:Feature Learning: Deep learning models can automatically learn relevant features from raw data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering, which can be time-consuming and prone to human biases.Highly Accurate: Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.Scalability: Deep learning models can scale with increasing amounts of data and computational resources. More data often leads to better performance, given sufficient computational power for training.Versatility: Deep learning models can be adapted to various types of data and tasks, making them versatile across different domains and applications.Continual Improvement: With ongoing research and development, deep learning techniques continue to advance, leading to improvements in model accuracy and efficiency.Cons of using deep learning:Data Dependency: Deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training, and their performance heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the data. Obtaining and labeling large datasets can be expensive and time-consuming.Computational Resources: Training deep learning models often demands significant computational resources, including high-performance GPUs or even specialized hardware like TPUs. This can make deep learning expensive to implement, particularly for smaller organizations or individuals.Black Box Nature: Deep learning models are often considered black boxes because they lack interpretability. It can be challenging to understand why a model makes a particular decision, which can be problematic in applications where interpretability is crucial, such as healthcare or finance.Overfitting: Deep learning models are susceptible to overfitting, where they memorize the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns. Techniques like regularization and dropout are used to mitigate overfitting, but it remains a significant challenge, especially with limited training data.Complexity and Expertise: Building and tuning deep learning models require expertise in neural network architectures, hyperparameter optimization, and computational techniques. Additionally, understanding and debugging deep learning algorithms can be challenging, requiring specialized knowledge and experience`
